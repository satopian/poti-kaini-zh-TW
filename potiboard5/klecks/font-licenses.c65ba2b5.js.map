This may\r\ninclude source files, build scripts and documentation.\r\n\r\n\\`\"Reserved Font Name\"\\` refers to any names specified as such after the\r\ncopyright statement(s).\r\n\r\n\\`\"Original Version\"\\` refers to the collection of Font Software components as\r\ndistributed by the Copyright Holder(s).\r\n\r\n\\`\"Modified Version\"\\` refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,\r\nor substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the\r\nOriginal Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a\r\nnew environment.\r\n\r\n\\`\"Author\"\\` refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical\r\nwriter or other person who contributed to the Font Software.\r\n\r\n\r\nPermission & Conditions\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,\r\nredistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font\r\nSoftware, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1. Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,\r\n   in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.\r\n\r\n2. Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,\r\n   redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy\r\n   contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be\r\n   included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or\r\n   in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or\r\n   binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.\r\n\r\n3. No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font\r\n   Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding\r\n   Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as\r\n   presented to the users.\r\n\r\n4. The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font\r\n   Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any\r\n   Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the\r\n   Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written\r\n   permission.\r\n\r\n5. The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,\r\n   must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be\r\n   distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to\r\n   remain under this license does not apply to any document created\r\n   using the Font Software.\r\n\r\n\r\nTermination\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are\r\nnot met.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCLAIMER\r\n\r\n    THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\n    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT\r\n    OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT.
